## Research Interests

My research focuses on:

- **Pharmacokinetics (PK)**: Understanding drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME)
- **Pharmacodynamics (PD)**: Studying drug effects and mechanisms of action
- **PK/PD Modeling**: Developing and validating integrated pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic models
- **Population Pharmacokinetics**: Characterizing variability in drug exposure and response across populations
- **Modeling & Simulation**: Using NONMEM, R, Python, and mrgsolve for quantitative pharmacology
- **Clinical Trial Analysis**: Analyzing pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data from clinical studies
