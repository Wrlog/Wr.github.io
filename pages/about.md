## Professional Experience

### Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center | Cincinnati, OH
**Graduate Research Assistant (Pharmacometrics)** | *August 2022 - Present*

- **PopPK/PD Modeling:** Spearheaded the development of mechanistic Population PK/PD models for Infliximab (biologic) and Piperacillin (small molecule) using NONMEM, identifying key covariates to optimize dosing regimens for pediatric patients.

- **Machine Learning Integration:** Implemented advanced ML/DL algorithms (Boosting, Bagging, Variational Autoencoders) to enhance predictive performance of disease response models.

- **Tool Development (R-Shiny):** Designed and deployed interactive R-Shiny dashboards to visualize PK simulation data, reducing data interpretation time for clinical teams and supporting biomarker-guided decision-making.

- **Clinical Consultation:** Served as the assistant PK consultant for clinical teams, analyzing TDM data to recommend precise dosage adjustments for immunosuppressants (Mycophenolic acid, Tacrolimus, Sirolimus) in high-risk pediatric patients.

- **Study Design Optimization:** Executed a D-optimal design study using PopED to determine optimal sampling timepoints for Dupilumab, maximizing information gain while minimizing patient burden in pediatric EoE trials.

### University of Malaya | Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia
**Research Assistant** | *March 2022 - May 2022*

- Performed rigorous data cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on large-scale patient datasets to support a Model-Informed Precision Dosing (MIPD) initiative for Vancomycin.

### Universiti Sains Malaysia | Penang, Malaysia
**Research Assistant** | *May 2021 - May 2022*

- Conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of Isoniazid Population PK models, establishing a framework for tuberculosis dosing in diverse populations.
