# Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! Here you'll find a collection of my projects, research work, and professional achievements.

## Featured Research Projects

### Research Project 1: PK/PD Modeling and Machine Learning Integration for Infliximab in Pediatric Crohn's Disease

_Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center | Aug 2022 - Present_

**Description**:
This project focuses on developing mechanistic Population PK/PD models for Infliximab (a monoclonal antibody biologic) in pediatric patients with Crohn's disease. The research integrates traditional pharmacometric modeling with advanced machine learning and deep learning approaches to enhance predictive performance and optimize dosing regimens.

**Objectives**:

- Develop and validate population PK/PD models for Infliximab in pediatric patients
- Identify key covariates affecting drug exposure and response
- Optimize dosing regimens for pediatric patients using model-informed approaches
- Enhance disease response prediction using machine learning and deep learning algorithms
- Develop exposure-response relationships to guide clinical decision-making

**Methodology**:

- **Population PK/PD Modeling**: Developed mechanistic population PK/PD models using NONMEM, incorporating patient-specific covariates (body size, disease status, immunogenicity)
- **Exposure-Response Analysis**: Established quantitative relationships between drug exposure metrics (AUC, trough concentrations) and clinical endpoints (disease activity scores, biomarker responses)
- **Machine Learning Integration**:
  - Implemented XGBoost (gradient boosting) and Random Forest (bagging) algorithms to predict disease response
  - Developed Variational Autoencoder (VAE) models for feature extraction and dimensionality reduction
  - Compared ML model performance with traditional PK/PD models
- **Software/Tools**: NONMEM, R (Tidyverse, ggplot2), Python (scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch), mrgsolve

**Key Findings**:

- Identified critical covariates affecting Infliximab pharmacokinetics in pediatric patients
- Established exposure-response relationships that inform optimal dosing strategies
- Demonstrated improved predictive performance through ML/DL model integration
- Contributed to personalized dosing recommendations for pediatric patients

**Publications/Presentations**:

- **Conference Presentation**: "PK/PD Modeling of Infliximab in Children with Crohn's Disease" - IATDMCT 2025 (Top 10 Abstract Nomination)
- **Award**: Top 10 Abstract Nomination (Poster Award), IATDMCT Conference (2025)

### Research Project 2: Model-Informed Dose Optimization for Prophylactic Piperacillin-Tazobactam in Perioperative Pediatric Critically Ill Patients

_Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center | Aug 2022 - Present_

**Description**:
This research project focuses on optimizing prophylactic dosing regimens for piperacillin-tazobactam (a beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combination antibiotic) in pediatric critically ill patients undergoing perioperative care. The study addresses the critical need for appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis dosing in pediatric populations, where dosing strategies are often extrapolated from adult data without proper validation.

**Objectives**:

- Develop population PK models for piperacillin-tazobactam in pediatric critically ill patients
- Identify key covariates affecting drug exposure (body size, renal function, critical illness)
- Optimize prophylactic dosing regimens to achieve target exposure thresholds
- Evaluate the impact of body size and renal function on dosing requirements
- Provide evidence-based dosing recommendations for clinical practice

**Methodology**:

- **Population PK Modeling**: Developed population PK models using NONMEM to characterize piperacillin pharmacokinetics in pediatric patients
- **Covariate Analysis**: Evaluated the impact of body size (weight, BSA), renal function (creatinine clearance), and critical illness status on drug clearance and volume of distribution
- **Model-Informed Simulations**: Conducted Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate different dosing regimens and determine optimal dosing strategies
- **Target Attainment Analysis**: Assessed the probability of target attainment (PTA) for prophylactic efficacy endpoints
- **Tool Development (R-Shiny)**: Designed and deployed interactive R-Shiny dashboards to visualize PK simulation data, reducing data interpretation time for clinical teams and supporting biomarker-guided decision-making
- **Software/Tools**: NONMEM, R (Tidyverse, ggplot2, R-Shiny), Pirana, mrgsolve

**Key Findings**:

- Identified body size and renal function as critical covariates affecting piperacillin pharmacokinetics
- Demonstrated that standard dosing regimens may be suboptimal for certain pediatric patient populations
- Developed optimized dosing regimens that account for patient-specific factors
- Provided evidence-based recommendations for prophylactic dosing in perioperative pediatric care
- Contributed to improved antibiotic stewardship and patient outcomes
