## Hysteresis

Hysteresis may be defined as the retardation or lagging of an effect behind the cause of the effect.

## How hysteresis occur

**Counter-clockwise hysteresis**

Some potential causes for counter-clockwise-hysteresis include distribution delay between the plasma and effect site, response delay,distributional delay, feedback regulation, input and output rate changes,
sensitization of receptors, the formation and subsequent accumulation of active metabolites through drug metabolism as well as up regulation of receptors after ongoing exposure
and the use of racemic drugs.

**Clockwise hysteresis**

A clockwise hysteresis loop occurs when rapid tolerance (tachyphylaxis) develops. The response for a given plasma concentration is initially high, but decreases as tolerance rapidly develops.

Examples are cocaine or indirectly acting sympathomimetic drugs such as pseudoephedrine.
