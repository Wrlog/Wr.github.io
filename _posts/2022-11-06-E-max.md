## Origin of Emax model

The field of PK/PD aims to develop conceptual models that link the time-course of drug exposure, in plasma or sites of action (biophase), to the time-course and intensity of pharmacological and/or toxicological effects. Levy was the first to develop a simple mathematical expression, connecting the PK and
pharmacological properties of a drug, to explain the apparent zero-order rate of decline of in vivo drug effects (E), despite an exponential decrease in drug concentrations (Levy 1966):

With E0 as the effect value at the start of the decrease in E, k is a first-order elimination rate constant of the drug, m represents the linear positive slope of a concentration-effect plot when the effect is between 20 and 80 % maximal (abscissa = natural log of drug concentration and ordinate = effect on a linear scale), and t is time. This expression identifies the k \* m product as the determinant of the linear decrease in drug effects for simple, rapid direct effects (i.e., reversible agonists or antagonists for which turnover processes are not rate-limiting). This discovery marked the beginning of identifying factors that regulate the in vivo time-course of drug effects in a quantitative manner.

Shortly thereafter, Wagner suggested the use of the **Hill equation** to describe the temporal profile of direct and rapidly acting agents, which was based on a derivation starting with drug-receptor binding (Hill 1910; Wagner 1968):

with C(t) representing the plasma drug concentration, Emax is the maximal drug effect, and EC50 is the drug concentration producing 50 % of Emax. The use of the full Hill equation (or Emax model) avoided the restriction of the 20 to 80 % maximal effect as required for Eq. 1.1. However, the Emax model assumes that the time to peak drug effect coincides with the time to peak drug concentration, although most drugs exhibit a temporal delay between these events (so called hysteresis in the concentration-effect plot). Sheiner popularized the use of a simple delay compartment, initially developed by Segre, to accommodate the time for drug to equilibrate with concentrations in a hypothetical effect compartment or biophase (Segre 1968; Sheiner et al. 1979). The pharmacological effect is still defined by Eq. 1.2, but driven by concentrations in the effect compartment rather than plasma concentration. This was the first simultaneous PK/PD model to describe a relatively short delay in drug action owing to drug distribution to a biophase and assumes such distribution does not influence the PK of the drug.

Many drugs can show much longer delays, not due to distribution to a biophase,
but because drug-target interactions can act indirectly to stimulate or inhibit the
production (Kin) or loss (kout) of a biomarker (R) (Ariens 1954). Levy and colleagues
published the first model to capture an indirect effect (Nagashima et al.1969), and Jusko and colleagues introduced a mathematical formalism for a family of four basic indirect response models (Dayneka et al. 1993; Jusko and Ko 1994).
A general expression for these models is:

With H1 and H2 representing Emax functions (Eq. 1.2), and R0 is the initial condition
for the biomarker. Interestingly, the time to peak (or nadir) of drug effects is
independent of dose for the biophase model, whereas this property will shift to the
right with increasing dose levels for the indirect effect models, owing to the longer
duration of time drug concentrations remain above its EC50. Although the biophase
and indirect effect models can describe delays between peak concentration and peak
response, neither will describe a case in which there is a long delay in the onset of
effect, when the biomarker does not change despite high drug concentrations. For
such systems, the use of simple transit compartments can be used to emulate the
time required for signal transduction delays with a minimal number of identifiable
parameters (Mager and Jusko 2001). From these basic structural models, one can
add a plethora of additional complexities and arrive at a diverse array of PK/PD
models for describing many animal and clinical drug effects.

## Emax

Emax graphical model is a very important model to describe the pharmacodynamics of a drug. It gives the possibility to describe the efficacy and potency of a drug with graphical means. In an Emax model, Potency = EC50, which is a concentration read from X-axis, and Efficacy = Emax, which is a dose-response read from Y-axis. Potency and efficacy are independent of each other. Neither can predict the other.

Example of Emax Graphical model is as follow :
