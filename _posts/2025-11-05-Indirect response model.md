**Exposure Response**

What Are Indirect Response (IDR) Models?

In a simple "direct" model, we assume the drug concentration directly drives the effect. (More drug = more effect, instantly).

An indirect response model is used when the drug does not act directly on the measured effect. Instead, the drug influences the turnover (the synthesis or degradation) of an endogenous (natural) substance, and it's the level of this substance that we measure as the effect.

The "Bathtub" AnalogyThis is the easiest way to understand it. Think of the effect you are measuring (like the level of a clotting factor, a hormone, or a biomarker) as the water level in a bathtub.$k_{in}$ (or 5$R_{syn}$): This is the faucet, representing the body's constant, zero-order production rate of the substance.6$k_{out}$: This is the drain, representing the body's constant, first-order elimination rate (or "loss") of the substance.7Baseline ($R_0$): With no drug, the faucet ($k_{in}$) and drain ($k_{out}$) are in balance, so the water level (your baseline effect) is stable.The drug does not directly change the water level.8 Instead, the drug interferes with the faucet or the drain.
