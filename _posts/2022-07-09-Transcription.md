**Transcription Factor**

Transcription factors are proteins involved in the process of converting, or transcribing, DNA into RNA. Transcription factors include a wide number of proteins, excluding RNA polymerase, that initiate and regulate the transcription of genes. One distinct feature of transcription factors is that they have DNA-binding domains
that give them the ability to bind to specific sequences of DNA called enhancer or promoter sequences.

Some transcription factors bind to a DNA promoter sequence near the transcription start site and help form the transcription initiation complex.
Other transcription factors bind to regulatory sequences, such as enhancer sequences, and can either stimulate or repress transcription of the related gene.

These regulatory sequences can be thousands of base pairs upstream or downstream from the gene being transcribed. Regulation of transcription is the most common form of gene control.
The action of transcription factors allows for unique expression of each gene in different cell types and during development.

**Chromatin and Nucleosome**

Chromatin is a complex of DNA and proteins that forms chromosomes within the nucleus of eukaryotic cells. The main purpose of chromatin is to tightly pack the DNA inside the cell nucleus.
Chromatin regulates the gene expression and allows DNA replication in addition to the packaging. It also prevents DNA damage.

Nucleosome refers to the main structural unit of the eukaryotic chromatin that consists of a length of DNA coiled around a core of histones. This means the core particles that form chromatin are the nucleosomes. A nucleosome consists of 146 base pairs long DNA stretches, wrapped around a core of histone.
The histone core is made up of eight histone proteins. The histone octamer is formed by combining two of each four histones, H2A, H2B, H3, and H4.

**Trans-regulatory sequences**

Trans-regulatory sequences are transcription factor proteins that regulate the process of transcription such as general TFs and RNA pol2, sequence specific TFs, co-activators/co-repressor and histones.

**Cis-regulatory sequences**

Cis-regulatory sequences are noncoding DNA sequences in or near a gene required for proper spatiotemporal expression of that gene, often containing binding sites for transcription factors such as enhancers promoters and insulator, control development and physiology by regulating gene expression.

**Primary Cell**

Primary cells are cells taken directly from living tissue (e.g. biopsy material) and established for growth in vitro.
