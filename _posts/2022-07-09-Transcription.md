## Transcription Factors

Transcription factors are proteins that play a crucial role in the process of **transcription**, which converts DNA into RNA. While RNA polymerase performs the actual synthesis of RNA, transcription factors (excluding RNA polymerase itself) initiate and regulate gene transcription.

### Key Characteristics

- **DNA-binding domains**: Transcription factors possess specialized domains that enable them to recognize and bind to specific DNA sequences
- **Regulatory sequences**: They bind to **promoter sequences** (near transcription start sites) or **enhancer sequences** (often distant from the gene)

### Functions

1. **Transcription initiation**: Some transcription factors bind to promoter sequences and help assemble the transcription initiation complex
2. **Gene regulation**: Other transcription factors bind to enhancer sequences and can either:
   - **Activate** (stimulate) transcription
   - **Repress** (inhibit) transcription

### Importance

- Regulatory sequences can be located thousands of base pairs upstream or downstream from the target gene
- Transcription regulation is the most common mechanism of gene control
- Transcription factors enable cell-type-specific and developmental stage-specific gene expression patterns

## Chromatin and Nucleosomes

### Chromatin

**Chromatin** is a complex of DNA and proteins that forms chromosomes within the nucleus of eukaryotic cells. Its primary functions include:

1. **DNA packaging**: Compacts DNA to fit within the cell nucleus
2. **Gene expression regulation**: Controls access to DNA, thereby regulating gene expression
3. **DNA replication**: Facilitates the replication process
4. **DNA protection**: Prevents DNA damage

### Nucleosomes

**Nucleosomes** are the fundamental structural units of chromatin. Each nucleosome consists of:

- **DNA component**: Approximately 146 base pairs of DNA wrapped around a histone core
- **Histone core**: An octamer composed of eight histone proteins:
  - Two copies each of H2A, H2B, H3, and H4

Nucleosomes serve as the building blocks that organize DNA into higher-order chromatin structures.

## Regulatory Sequences

### Cis-Regulatory Sequences

**Cis-regulatory sequences** are non-coding DNA sequences located in or near a gene that control its expression. Key features:

- **Location**: Found on the same chromosome as the gene they regulate
- **Function**: Required for proper spatiotemporal (spatial and temporal) gene expression
- **Components**: Include:
  - **Enhancers**: Sequences that enhance transcription
  - **Promoters**: Sequences that initiate transcription
  - **Insulators**: Sequences that block enhancer-promoter interactions

These sequences contain binding sites for transcription factors and play critical roles in development and physiology by regulating gene expression patterns.

### Trans-Regulatory Sequences

**Trans-regulatory sequences** (more accurately called **trans-regulatory factors**) are proteins that regulate transcription by binding to cis-regulatory sequences. They include:

- **General transcription factors** (TFs) and **RNA polymerase II** (RNA pol2)
- **Sequence-specific transcription factors**
- **Co-activators** and **co-repressors**
- **Histones** and histone-modifying enzymes

Unlike cis-regulatory sequences, trans-regulatory factors are encoded by genes that may be located on different chromosomes from the genes they regulate.

## Primary Cells

**Primary cells** are cells isolated directly from living tissue (e.g., biopsy material) and cultured in vitro. Unlike immortalized cell lines, primary cells:

- Maintain characteristics closer to their in vivo state
- Have a limited lifespan in culture
- Are valuable for research that requires cells with natural biological properties
